## Methodology ⚙️

### Dataset 📊

The dataset contains:

* Geographical data: Longitude, Latitude
* Demographic data: Population, Median Income
* Housing data: Total Rooms, Total Bedrooms, Households, Housing Median Age, Median House Value (target variable)

### Models Implemented 🧮

The following regression models were used in this project:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
5. **K-Neighbors Regressor**
6. **Lasso Regression**

## Results 📈

### Key Takeaways

* The model provides a strong indication of how income levels and proximity to coastal areas impact housing prices.
* Houses in higher-income neighborhoods or close to the coast tend to have higher prices.
* Older houses are generally valued slightly lower.

### Best Model

The best-performing model is the **Random Forest Regressor**, which effectively balances accuracy and interpretability:

* **Train Results**:

  * Predicted prices are highly accurate, closely matching actual prices.
* **Test Results**:

  * Reliable predictions, with slight variations from actual values.

These insights provide valuable guidance for businesses and policymakers.

## Conclusion 🏁

The project successfully delivers actionable insights for predicting housing prices in California. The findings highlight critical factors influencing price variations, offering practical recommendations for real estate professionals, investors, and urban planners.

### Recommendations 📝

* **For Real Estate Professionals**:

  * Focus on properties in high-income areas or near coastal regions to maximize returns.
  * Consider renovation investments in older properties to increase market value.

* **For Policymakers**:

  * Use insights to guide housing policies and zoning regulations.
  * Support affordable housing initiatives in areas with high price trends.
